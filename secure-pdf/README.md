# Introduction

Secure PDF is a Python project designed to enhance the security of PDF files by encrypting them with a password. The need for such a tool arises from the real-world challenge of protecting sensitive information contained in PDF files. The script uses the PyPDF2 library for PDF manipulation and colorama for colored terminal text.

# Problems

The primary problem that Secure PDF addresses is the vulnerability of standard PDF files. Without encryption, anyone who can access the file can view its contents. Secure PDF provides a solution by allowing users to encrypt their PDF files with a password.

# Solutions

The main solution provided by Secure PDF is a function, lock_pdf, that encrypts a given PDF file with a provided password. An alternative would be to use a different library or method for PDF encryption. However, PyPDF2 is a widely used library with robust functionality.

# Conclusion

Secure PDF demonstrates a simple and effective way to add a layer of security to PDF files. It shows how Python and its libraries can be used to solve real-world problems. The key takeaway is that with a few lines of code, we can significantly enhance the security of our documents.

# Next Steps

The best solution is to continue using the lock_pdf function for PDF encryption. However, to improve Secure PDF, it is recommended to add functionality that allows the user to choose whether to overwrite the original file or save the encrypted PDF as a new file. This feature could be implemented by adding an optional parameter to the lock_pdf function. The implementation of this feature should be done by the original script developer or someone with a good understanding of the script and Python. It can be done immediately as it doesnâ€™t require any additional resources.
